Data for a variety of experiments and conditions. Namely:

1) Fixed Strat Experiments.zip
    Preliminary simulations with fixed strategies, to analyse sans-imitation migratory behaviours
    N = 50, R = 5, T = 201
2) CC Experiments.zip
    Still fixed strategies but now measuring the clusters that form
    N = 50, R = 5, T = 201
3) Full Sims.zip
    a) Contains experiments with both migration and imitation but with no mutation. 
        N = 50, R = 5, T = 201
    b) Mutation/
        Experiments with migration, imitation AND mutation
        N = 50, R = 5, T = 201, epsilon = 0.01
    c) Density/
        Similar to experiments in Mutation/ folder but now also varies density (ie number of agents)
        
Subfolders in each zipped file contains readme's for more specific parameters and data specification.
