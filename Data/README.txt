Data for a variety of experiments and conditions. Namely:

1) Fixed Strat Experiments/
    Preliminary simulations with fixed strategies, to analyse sans-imitation migratory behaviours
    N = 50, R = 5, T = 201
2) CC Experiments/
    Still fixed strategies but now measuring the clusters that form
    N = 50, R = 5, T = 201
3) Full Sims/
    a) Contains experiments with both migration and imitation but with no mutation. 
        N = 50, R = 5, T = 201
    b) Mutation/
        Experiments with migration, imitation AND mutation
        N = 50, R = 5, T = 201, epsilon = 0.01
    c) Density/
        Similar to experiments in Mutation/ folder but now also varies density (ie number of agents)
4) Animations
    Gifs and other animations
