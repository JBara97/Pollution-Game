Jupyter Notebooks that accomplish the following.

Simulations.ipynb:
  1. Creates animations as gifs of cities with mobile agents; 
      first to illustrate behaviour and then to classify migratory behaviours
  2. Simulations to analyse:
      a) Fixed strategies and time evolution (see Fixed Strat Experiments folder)
      b) Connected components i.e. clusters under fixed strategy (see CC Experiments folder)
      c) Full coevolutionary process, i.e. migration, imitation and mutation (see Full Sims folder) 
          under fixed density
      d) Full coevolutionary process with varying densities (see Full Sims/Density folder)
      
Manuscript Figures.ipynb:
  Code to produce figures from the paper
